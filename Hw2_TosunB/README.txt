EE576 Machine Vision: HOMEWORK 2

This project mainly consists of 3 files (2 .cpp, 1 .h). The main program for the project lies in the file named "main.cpp". The methods/functions used in the main program lie in the file name "Methods.cpp" and the header file for those methods is "hMethods.h".

ATTENTION:
1) To properly run the main program, all these three cpp files should be in the same place.

2) For our program to be able to read images, the images should be stored in another file/directory called "Data" and only the name of the image should be entered (with its extension) when it is asked.
