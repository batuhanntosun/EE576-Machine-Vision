EE576 Machine Vision: HOMEWORK 4

This project mainly consists of 4 files (2 .cpp, 1 .h, and 1 .txt). The main program for the project lies in the file named "main.cpp". The methods/functions used in the main program lie in the file name "Methods.cpp" and the header file for those methods is "hMethods.h". I prepared the text file "all_data.txt" in which the directories and labels of the "Scenes-5Places" dataset are written.

ATTENTION:

1) To properly run the main program, all these three cpp files should be in the same place.

2) "all_data.txt" file should be put in "Data" file/directory for the program to work properly. This text file will be used for reaching and reading the sample images. 

3) "Scenes-5Places.zip" file should be extracted into "Data" file/directory for the program to work properly.
