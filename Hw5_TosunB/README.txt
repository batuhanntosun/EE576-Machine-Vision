EE576 Machine Vision: HOMEWORK 5

This project mainly consists of 3 files (2 .cpp, 1 .h). The main program for the project lies in the file named "main.cpp". The methods/functions used in the main program lie in the file name "Methods.cpp" and the header file for those methods is "hMethods.h".

ATTENTION:

1) To properly run the main program, all these three cpp files should be in the same place.

2) The files in "Car2.zip" and "Human9.zip" should be extracted into "Data" file/directory for the program to work properly.
