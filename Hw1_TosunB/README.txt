EE576 Machine Vision: HOMEWORK 1

This project mainly consists of 4 files (2 .cpp, 1 .h and 1 .m). The main program for the project lies in the file named "main.cpp". The methods/functions used in the main program lie in the file name "Methods.cpp" and the header file for those methods is "hMethods.h".

ATTENTION:
1) To properly run the main program, all these three cpp files should be in the same place.

2) For our program to be able to read images, the images should be stored in another file/directory called "Data" and only the names of the images should be entered (with their extensions) when it is asked. The coordinates of the chosen points will be saved in this directory as well (in two differet .txt files)

3) The MATLAB file "findLinearSolution.m" should be also in the "Data" file/directory with the images to work properly.Or the user just change the directories of the images manually in the code.

4) The resuting homography matrix (using findLinearSolution) should be copied and pasted/entered to the command window by the user when it is asked by the program.
